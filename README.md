# ISC phase randomization simulation
Quick simulation to compare two approaches to phase randomization for constructing a null distribution for leave-one-out intersubject correlations (ISCs): 1. only phase randomize the left-out subject and averge non-phase-randomized other subjects; 2. phase randomization all subjects and average phase-randomized subjects.
